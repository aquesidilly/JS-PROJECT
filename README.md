### The Snake Game
 
 ## JS PROJECT
     * The aim of this project is to create snake game using the technologies I have learnt so far in my course module such as, HTML, Css, and Javascript. The aim of the site is to create contemporary game for a particular set of users.
     *  I have decided to created a snake game and I utilised all the elements I have learnt in mine subsequent modules to make the game a reality and also  good user experience to create and design this game.
     *  A simple snake game in java .Using game board to display the game.The code is well commented for use.

 ## Design
 
  # Colour Scheme
     *  The two main colours used to create the game are blue colour #hsl, and a yellow colour #hsl representing the snake and food. Other colours were also used for border and background colour between the two main colours to create sections when playing the game .
     *  I also used black colour  for my borders respectively and also cream colour #ccc for my game board to display the snake and the food .

 ## Feature

  # Current Features
     * Reponsive
          - This is the first responsive snake game which is available  on all screen sizes

 ## Deployment

  # Github, Gitpod, Git and Gitub pages
     * How to run the project:.

         - I first created a repository cloning the Code Institutes template on my github page.
         - Once created I opened the page in Gitpod.
         - I then used the terminal to create my index.html file ie, touch index.html.
         - I then created my assets folder , to hold snakeGame.js,food.js,input.js,snake.js and matrix.js.
         - I then created the style.css file within the css folder.
     * Git

         - Once I created the main files and folders I then used the git add . command to add them to the staging area.
         - Once they were staged I then used git commit -m "initial commit" to commit them to github.
         - I then used git push to push the files onto my gihub page.
         - I used these steps to commit the project regularly throughout the development to keep everything saved and up to date on my github.
         - To make my project live I then used github pages.

         - Open a workspace in gitpod in my github
         - create a javascript project in my gitpod

  # How to play the game
